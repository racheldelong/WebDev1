# Code Kentucky Web Development 1 Project Plan

### **Project Objective**

Create a portfolio page with thumbnails to show or hide individual images, collapsible thumbnail section, and image title that updates when a new image is selected.

**Statement of Work**

I'm going to create a thumbnail section with CSS flexbox (separate from the navigation bar), then use an accordion box to collapse or expand the thumbnail section to increase the screen space if needed for viewing images. Thumbnails will show or hide larger versions of each image when clicked. I'm also going to use a Javascript array to update the image title when a new image is shown.

### **Project Features**

- Feature 1: Create a responsive navigation menu with CSS

- Feature 2: Create a simple hide/show div with CSS

- Feature 3: Create accordion boxes to display different types of information

- Feature 4: Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on the page
